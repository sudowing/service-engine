This README provides an overview of how to use this framework to (quickly) build `REST`, `GraphQL` and `gRPC` services -- detailing all features and configuration options. 

Anyone intested in exploring how this all works is free to inspect the source.

That being said, there are a great many people who would benefit from a guided overview of this project and a walkthrough of implementing against different DBs.

To support this, I've produced a series of videos
where I provide a detailed walk-through of how this system works, detail each component and explain the requirements and various considerations that went into each  design decision.
