# Design & Development Walkthroughs

This documention provides an overview of how to use this service, detailing all features and configuration options. Anyone intested in exploring how this all works is free to inspect the source.

That being said, there are a great many people who would benefit from a guided overview of this project.

To support this, I've produced a series of videos
where I provide a detailed overview as to how this system works, detail each component and explain the requirements and various considerations that went into each and discuss the various decision made throughout the development.
