geoqueries were only ever done on the `center`. Anything marked as a geo field in the validator was published as geoJson
```
Guidance I got was to use QGIS to import shapefiles and export as WKT (well known text) as that's how we stored data.

What worked for me was to:

    Delete the node_modules in both the dependency and the consumer module.
    Run npm unlink --no-save [dependency-module]
    re-link with the 2-link commands as per npm-link

Now I am able to fully test my unpublished module locally.

Additionally, there is an npm pack command which can help you test your unpublished modules, although not quite as robust.
