update logger with file and trace
make every http call get logged to debug

CRUD OPTIONS in service-config
relationships in service-config (for when fk is not a constraint)
unique vs primary key (if table has no PK -- fallback to unique key if exists and provide READ, UPDATE & DELETE)

ALL VALIDATION needs to be async

  define relationships via config if fk not set
    fk defines itself (used for GraphQL)

add support for mysql (count object will look different)
add support for sqlite
add support for oracle

config based flag for custom types (which will need to all be strings)
if yes,
    strings
if no...
    throw error || graceful shutdown with verbose messages

standardize connection for db config

connect to mysql and sqlite

hard delete vs soft delete.
Currently only soft delete is enabled

create and update do not return for sqlite3

create many doesnt seem to work. QA against REST

read with zero matches doesn't 404


foreign key by inspection (for relationships in graphql)
dataloader

postgis
